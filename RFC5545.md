### Section 5 Recomended Practices

5.  Recommended Practices

   These recommended practices should be followed in order to assure
   consistent handling of the following cases for an iCalendar object.

   1.  Content lines longer than 75 octets SHOULD be folded.

   2.  When the combination of the "RRULE" and "RDATE" properties in a
       recurring component produces multiple instances having the same
       start DATE-TIME value, they should be collapsed to, and
       considered as, a single instance.  If the "RDATE" property is
       specified as a PERIOD value the duration of the recurrence
       instance will be the one specified by the "RDATE" property, and
       not the duration of the recurrence instance defined by the
       "DTSTART" property.

   3.  When a calendar user receives multiple requests for the same
       calendar component (e.g., REQUEST for a "VEVENT" calendar

### Section 3.8.5 Recurring Events
• some aspect (your choice)
• Recurring events
(and exceptions to recurrences) can be very complicated. Start small and do
what you can. For example, you might want to start with being able to
schedule a meeting on the 25th of every month. Then add the ability to do
exceptions, such as “except in December”).
